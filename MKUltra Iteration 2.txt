Write down a list of things your team feels they did wrong or poorly and the name of the person who brought it up
	1. Organization is still an issue, with people sometimes doing the same job independently. (Shariann)
	2. Coordination could be much better. I like the team leader(s) idea to help make this work better (James)
	3. Specifically, I think we are incorrectly implementing the "story" concept as a team. My understandin (and experience) with stories is that we break features down to the story level and 
	then each story gets assigned to one person during an iteration. That gives each of us a clear idea of what we're working on and will address the independent overlap issue as noted in item #1. (Austin)
	4.Communication has broken down(Frank Gadri).

Write down a list of things your team did right and the name of the person who brought it up.
	1. Improved understanding of the project and what is needed to complete it. (Shariann)
	2. People are proactively completing their stories. (Austin)
	3. More research is being done before implementation.(Frank Gadri)

Write down 2 goals for your team to improve on.
	1. I think we should establish a leader or leader(s). Someone suggested having two: 
	one for the server side and one for the android side.  I think this is a great idea!  
	Having two people coordinate what needs to be done (and passing that on to their half of the team) 
	is a lot easier than getting all six of us together. (Shariann)
	2.Improve communication and spend a more time on my part of the project(Frank Gadri)

	3. More integration between both sides of the project.


List of all the stories to completed from the previous iteration
	1. Research for address conversion
		Status: Complete
		Team member: Shariann
		Size: 3
		Notes: We will be using Google Maps' Reverse Geocoding.
		Add to stories: Add map display to UI (attached to table)


	2. Set up team account for Google Maps API
		Status: Complete
		Team member: Shariann
		Size: 1
		Notes: See Github file for details.


	3. Implementation of address conversion
		Status: In Progress (Implementation)
		Team member: Shariann
		Size: 6 + ?
		Notes: I'm learning about php and web programming in general
		as I go, so this may take some time. The current size includes
		php research.


	4. HTTP Query to Google Maps API
		Status: Complete
		Team member: Shariann & Brian
		Size: 2
		Notes: I discovered that we have to actually show a map
		in order to have permission to use the Geocoding stuff.


	4. Implementation of sortable table
		Status: In Progress (Implementation)
		Team member: Shariann
		Size: 1 + ?
		Notes: I think having place names instead of GPS coordinates
		for the web display will be more important than added sorting
		functionality, so I'm focusing on the address conversion for now.


	5. Cross browser compatibility
		Status: Complete
		Team member: Brian
		Size: 3


	6. UI Design

		Status:Complte
		Team member:Frank Gadri
		Size:3
		Notes:Decide to use SQLite for my database on the Android side.


List of all the stories you are attempting to complete by the end of this iteration
	1. Implementation of address conversion
		Status: In Progress (Coding)
		Team member: Shariann
		Size: 6 + ?


	2. Implementation of sortable table
		Status: In Progress (Research)
		Team member: Shariann

		Status: Not started
		Team member: James & Austin
