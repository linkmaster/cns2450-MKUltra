Write down a list of things your team feels they did wrong or poorly and the name of the person who brought it up
	1. Organization is still an issue, with people sometimes doing the same job independently. (Shariann)


Write down a list of things your team did right and the name of the person who brought it up.
	1. Improved understanding of the project and what is needed to complete it. (Shariann)


Write down 2 goals for your team to improve on.
	1. I think we should establish a leader or leader(s). Someone suggested having two: one for the server side and one for the android side.  I think this is a great idea!  Having two people coordinate what needs to be done (and passing that on to their half of the team) is a lot easier than getting all six of us together. (Shariann)

	2. More integration between both sides of the project.

	4. Implementation of sortable table
		Status: In Progress (Implementation)
		Team member: Shariann
		Size: 1 + ?
		Notes: I think having place names instead of GPS coordinates
