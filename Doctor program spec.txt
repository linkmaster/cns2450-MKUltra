Team MKUltra

Audience: Mostly the doctor, but we also have to worry about the patient's experience. If they are only using text messages, this should not be a problem. The secretaries will need to have a UI to work with as well.

Time Estimation: 6 months, almost all of it is straightforward and requires very little effort. Hardest part is creating the bar graph.

Language: PHP and JavaScript, probably want to use jquery.

Platform: user wants a web app, so web browsers. Client said that he only really used chrome, but we should still check for IE/Firefox compliance just to be safe.

Additional Features: 
	1.  Separate database from his usual one
	2.  Implement bar graphs to show reports
		a. 1 bar graph showing what they have taken
		b. 1 bar graph showing what days they have missed
		c. Show at least a year at a time
	3.  Text message to patients
	4.  Automated phone process (Probably not going to happen unless the client wants to extend the due date another month or so.
	5.  Customer needs to be able to respond via text message
	6.  Needs by the end of the year (due date almost certainly a stretch)
	7.  App or web form for secretary to enter data. Must not be able to view data after (Error prone, should discuss with client)
	8.  Server space to store all data
		a. Client said  no more than $1000 a year on storage space
	9.  Doctor currently has 500 or so patients, is expecting that number to grow. 
		a. Scalability must be considered but most likely won't be a huge issue
		b. Multiple accounts to allow for multiple doctors.
	10. Popup message/ toast on mobile devices. Almost certainly not going into the final spec.
