Questions:
-what about database?  where do we store it?  is one provided?
-track more than one phone?
-login to phone? who controls who can track the phone?
-in the web format, do we need a visual map, GPS coordinates, etc?
-monthly history?  in text format, or visual?
	*note:  visual would probably be very messy...
	-for monthly, are we tracking average location (by day/week/month?) or a general map? text - location by GPS? city/state/country?


base case:  one user, login from web attached to a single phone... android version 
+multi user:  probably very easy - 5 minutes?
